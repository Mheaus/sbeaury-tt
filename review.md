Your technical test is good.
It seems you've got some experience and you're able to adapt to current front-end techs with react even if there's no demonstration of strength ( very complex ui or logic ).

Very good points :
  - the app works
  - the code is clear / linted
  - tests
  - typescript types are clean, usage of enums ( take care that a good object const is sometime simpler and clearer to use than enums )
  - good commit history !
  - the app is deployed

Personal advices :
  - get involved in GraphQL if the company mentions it, because if they are, they'll be less interested by any REST calls or pagination with REST since it's now common skill
  - comment your code with your mental process and thoughts ( "I've done this here because", "this util function is for", "I like doing this because" ... ), really not necessary but people how are doing good comments or just comments are very very valuable
  - free yourself from conventions and just stick to common good practices ( folder names with `-`, data fetching functions spread into 5 files => group everything where you use it, stay simple )
  - show that you use and create forms


I've no doubt you'll find a good opportunity and I wish you all the best.
